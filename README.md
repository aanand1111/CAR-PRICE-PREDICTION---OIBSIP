# CAR-PRICE-PREDICTION---OIBSIP
CAR PRICE PREDICTION WITH MACHINE LEARNING
# Objective
The objective of this project is to predict the selling price of cars based on various features such as the car's brand, features, horsepower, mileage, and more. Predicting car prices accurately can help buyers and sellers make informed decisions, thereby facilitating better negotiations and transactions.
# Solution
To achieve the objective, we employ machine learning techniques to build a predictive model. The solution involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training and evaluation, hyperparameter tuning, feature importance analysis, and model saving. We utilize Python and several of its libraries, including Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, and Joblib.
